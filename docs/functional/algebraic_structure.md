**What is an Algebraic Structure?**

According to Wikipedia
```
In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, 
an algebraic structure on a set A (called carrier set or underlying set) is a collection of finitary operations on A; 
the set A with this structure is also called an algebra.
```

Monad, Functor, Monoid, Applicative etc
